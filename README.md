### Hey ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently trying to get into a competitive CS program.
- I'm most experienced with web dev.
- I kinda just build things to solve my own problems. If I don't know something, I'll learn while building.
- Huge ios music app project is in the works ðŸ‘€, may or may not open source it, depends if apple likes me or not.
- Yes I have lots of commits, most of which are from abandoned projects. I wouldn't publish something that doesn't work and is garbage.
